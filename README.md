# Quadratic equation solver

*This app can help you to solve quadratic equation for real numbers. You can choose interactive mode, when you can enter the equation coefficients in real time and the program will output the roots for your equation. Also, there is non-interactive mode, when you upload file with your problem and the program gives you solution.*

## How to install
1. Install Oracle JDK or OpenJDK
2. Clone this repository on your local computer
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IrinaV713/lab1-git-basics-equation
```
3. Open a command prompt window and go to the directory where Main.java file is.
4. Type 'javac Main.java' and press enter to compile your code.
5. Type 'java Main' to run your program.

## How to use
1. When the program is run, you firstly must choose the mode to operate. Type '0' for interactive mode, type '1' for file mode.
2. If you choose '0', program will ask you to input coefficients a, b, c. Type yours, click Enter, and solution will be shown.
3. If you choose '1', type full path to file with your equation. File content format 'a\sb\sc\n'. '\s' stands for white space, '\n' for new line symbol. a, b, c are your preferred coefficients.
